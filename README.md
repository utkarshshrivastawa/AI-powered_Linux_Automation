# AI-powered_Linux_Automation
## ✅ I built an AI-powered Linux Automation Tool that executes Linux commands based on natural language instructions.

## 💻 I used VirtualBox to set up a virtual environment and installed Red Hat Linux as the operating system for real-time testing.

## 🧑‍💻 I wrote the automation code in Python, using the subprocess module to run Linux commands.

## 🧠 I integrated the Gemini 1.5 Flash model from Google to convert plain English instructions into valid Linux terminal commands.

## 🌐 I used Gradio to build a clean and interactive web-based interface, so users can simply type what they want the system to do.

## 🔁 The tool supports any valid Linux command — just type your instruction, and the system handles the rest.

## 🚀 This project combines AI, automation, and Linux to simplify system tasks for both beginners and advanced users.
